## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, Pflightdelay, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### Install Packages and Include Libraries

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyr")
#install.packages("dplyr")
#install.packages("stringr")
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
```

#Step1:
# Reading data as is from Pflightdelay and writing it to CSV file on Physical server.

```{r}
flightset <- 
    data.frame( header = c("","","Los Angeles","Phoenix","San Diego","San Francisco","Seattle"),
              al_ontime = c("ALASKA","on time","497","221","212","503","1841"),
              al_delayed = c("","delayed","62","12","20","102","305"),
              amwest_ontime = c("AM WEST","on time","694","4840","383","320","201"),
              amwest_delayed = c("","delayed","117","415","65","129","61") )
flight_delays <- data.frame(flightset$header,flightset$al_ontime,flightset$al_delayed,
                            flightset$amwest_ontime,flightset$amwest_delayed)
flight_delay <- t(flight_delays)
flight_delay
write.table(flight_delay, file = "~/Desktop/CUNY/5thWeek-TidyingData/flight_delay.csv", row.names = FALSE, col.names=FALSE,  sep = ",")
```

#Step2: Tidy and Transform Data by Preparing Molten Data
#1. Read csv file form Physical server
#2. Fill the rows which are missing and name the columns 
#3. Gather data by merging destination cities into one variable destination and observations per destination 
-Used gather function of TIDYR package to get the dataset based on Destination and switched columns
#4. Spread column Status observations into 2 columns on time and delayed and observations were added accordingly
-Used spread function of TIDYR package to split Status columns into separate columns vased values in it.

```{r}
#1
path <- "~/Desktop/CUNY/5thWeek-TidyingData/flight_delay.csv"
flightdelay <- data.frame(read.csv(path,stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
#2
names(flightdelay)[1] <- "Airline"
names(flightdelay)[2] <- "Status"
flightdelay$Airline[2] = flightdelay$Airline[1]
flightdelay$Airline[4] = flightdelay$Airline[3]
#3. Gather 
flightdelay <- gather(flightdelay,"Destination","Total",3:7)
flightdelay <- flightdelay[c(1,3,2,4)]
flightdelay
#4. Spread
flightdelay <- spread(flightdelay,Status,Total)
flightdelay

```


#Step3: Analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines
#1. Add acolumn Total adding delayed and on time and arrange flightdelat data frame by airline and Destination
#2. Calculate the Arrival Delays of 2 airlines ALASKA and AM WEST without considering destinations. Step 1 helps performance while -summarizing(Arrange helps performance) 
#3. Calculate the Arrival Delays of 2 airlines ALASKA and AM WEST by considering destinations
#4.Best Airlines by destination wise while considering delays: From #3 we get airline and destination based delay and we get a dataset
- for min delay based on airline which has airline and delay. Perform inner join 2 data sets to get the Airline.
-Airline_Delayed_Dest - Airline and Destination Wise Delay
-Destination_mindelay - Destination wise Delay
-BestAirlinebyDelay - Join of Airline_Delayed_Dest & Destination_mindelay which derices best performed airlines by Destination wise and -delay time
#5. Airport with most of the delays (Ratio)

```{r}
#1 Below
flightdelay <- mutate(flightdelay,Total = delayed + `on time`)
flightdelay <- arrange(flightdelay,desc(Airline))
#flightdelay

#2
Airline_Summary <- flightdelay %>% 
                  group_by(Airline) %>% 
                summarize(Airline_Delayed_All = sum(delayed),Airline_Ontime_All = sum(`on time`),Airline_Total_All = sum(Total))
Airline_Delayed_Summary <- select(Airline_Summary,Airline,Airline_Delayed_All)
Airline_Delayed_Summary

#3 
flightdelay <- arrange(flightdelay,Airline,Destination)

Airline_Dest_Summary <- flightdelay %>% 
                        group_by(Airline,Destination) %>% 
              summarize(Airline_Delayed_Dest = sum(delayed),Airline_Ontime_Dest = sum(`on time`),Airline_Total_Dest = sum(Total))
Airline_Delayed_Dest <- arrange(select(Airline_Dest_Summary,Airline,Destination,Airline_Delayed_Dest),Destination,Airline_Delayed_Dest)
Airline_Delayed_Dest

#4
Destination_mindelay <- Airline_Delayed_Dest %>% 
                        group_by(Destination) %>% 
                        summarise(Airline_Delayed_Dest = min(Airline_Delayed_Dest))  %>% 
                        select(Destination,Airline_Delayed_Dest) 
Destination_mindelay
BestAirlinebyDelay <- inner_join(Airline_Delayed_Dest,Destination_mindelay,by = c("Destination","Airline_Delayed_Dest"))
BestAirlinebyDelay

#5
#Destination wise Total Delayed and Total Ontime
Destination_Arr_Rates <- flightdelay %>% na.omit() %>% 
  group_by(Destination) %>% 
  summarise(delayed = sum(delayed), `on time` = sum(`on time`),Total = sum(Total) ) %>% 
  mutate(delayed_ratio = round((delayed * 100 / Total),2),ontime_ratio = round((`on time` * 100/Total),2)) %>%
  arrange(desc(delayed_ratio))
Destination_Arr_Rates
Destination_Arr_Rates[1,1]

```
